1. 
What's a "static method"?
    Answer: 
    A method you call directly on a class, not on an object based on it.

Question 2:
What's the idea behind "inheritance"?
    Answer: 
    You can set up a base class and then create more specialized classes that inherit from it.

Question 3:
What's an abstract class?
    Answer: 
    That's correct! Abstract classes can't be instantiated.

Question 4:
What's the idea behind "singleton classes"?    
    Answer: 
    A singleton class is configured such that you don't create it with "new" 
    but by calling a method which then ensures that only one instance of the class exists at any given time.
