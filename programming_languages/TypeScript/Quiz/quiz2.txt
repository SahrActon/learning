Good job!
That's correct. As you learned, callback functions can return something, even if the argument on which they're passed does NOT expect a returned value.
Question 1:
Will this code compile?

function sendRequest(data: string, cb: (response: any) => void) {
  // ... sending a request with "data"
  return cb({data: 'Hi there!'});
}
 
sendRequest('Send this!', (response) => { 
  console.log(response);
  return true;
 });


What's the idea behind a "function type"?
- Answer Function types define the parameters and return types of a function


Which code snippet is better (i.e. which code should you write)?

1)

function sayHi(): void {
  // ...
}
OR

2)

function sayHi(): undefined {
  // ...
}


1. Because it doesn't force you to return anything if you dont want to return anything
